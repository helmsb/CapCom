# CapCom
An extensible, cross-platform framework for building chatbots with a space flair!
## What is CapCom?
The **CapCom (Capsule Communicator)** is a member of the mission control team at NASA tasked with communicating between the ground and the astronauts. All requests are routed through her. 

In the same way CapCom is designed to be the bridge between you and your support tools. Simply ask CapCom to perform an action and it's done.

CapCom contains a simple extension mechanism for adding your own actions. These can be  used to work with a third party product or even with your own internal systems.

Also, CapCom is designed from the ground up to be cross-platform. The initial release will work with Flowdock but overtime I hope to add additional services including Slack, Microsoft Teams, Skype and Alexa.

## Roadmap
